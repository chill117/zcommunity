[b][size=4][color=blue]Description:[/color][/size][/b]
Powerful and flexible blog add-on for your Simple Machines forum.  Tons of options and features for one or an infinite number of blogs.  Use the Blogging Community mode to add a blogging community to your site or be selfish and just have your own blog.

Extreme flexibility because of the huge number of both admin-only options and individual blog settings.  You could have a community blog in which all your members can post articles.  You could have a blog in which only a select few members can post.  You could even have a wiki-style blog in which literally anybody can post/modify articles (even guests).  This is possible because you can add specific members to a blog's "Users Allowed to Post Articles" list or you can add entire member groups to a blog's "Groups Allowed to Post Articles" list.  And each blog's lists are their own.
